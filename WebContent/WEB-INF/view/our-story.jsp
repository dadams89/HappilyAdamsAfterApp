			    <p>The story starts with two college students who were working towards bettering themselves and their futures. Daniel was working long hours in a factory and going to school part-time for his asscociate's degree, with dreams of getting into the field of IT. Marisa, a former National Honor's Society member, was working as a nursing aid, paying her way through nursing school with dreams of
			    becoming a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner.
			    With little time to go out, Daniel and Marisa decided to join the dating application Plenty of Fish. One message led to another, texting and long phone calls into the night. After moving into their first apartment with their cat Macchiato, moving again and getting a puppy
			    that neither knew would be so challenging, each life event helped their relationship grow more.</p>
			    <p>Through graduations, new careers, more college and much more....the anticipation was there to get married. It didn't matter how many loved ones and friends said "When is it going
			    to happen?" or "When do you think he's going to propose?", they had to make sure the time was right. The two college students who wanted so much to make sure their lives were set before getting married
			    were finally ready!</p>
			    <h4 class="mb-5 mt-5 text-center"><u>The Proposal</u></h4>
			    <p>On Marisa's birthday, November 8th, 2017, Daniel surprised her with an intimate proposal in the comfort of their home. Her day started off by going to lunch with her friend Tatyana and going to visit her mother
			    in Madison, Daniel devised a plan to have Marisa bring her mother back to their house to stay the night for a "Doctor's Appointment" in the morning. Marisa's mom Marion was in on the plan and made sure that she got home
			    at the right time for the surprise. Daniel disabled the garage door opener so that she had to come in through the front door. Marisa, flustered and confused, hastily opened up the door to see her and Daniel's parents, a candle lit
			    pathway to her soon-to-be finace and large ballons spelling out "I LOVE YOU" (that she still hoards in the basement to this day (8+ months later)). Daniel proposed with one single red rose, which is significant because Grandpa Rosa
			    used to give Grandma Rosa one single red rose on special occasions. After composing herself, she said yes! ❤️</p>
			    
			    <p>Now, the wedding planning was in full effect and they were ready to become husband and wife! Just 5 years later, who would have known two people, so different in their earlier lives, would find such good love, friendship and partnership with each other.</p>
